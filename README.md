# Problem Statement

Develop a RESTful API service using Spring Boot to manage the exam enrollment process for a Learning Management System (LMS). You are required to use MySQL to persist the data.

# Problem Description

The exam registration service is a critical component of a Learning Management System. Generally, exam registration requires thorough Authentication and Authorization. For this assessment, your task is to develop a simplified version of the exam registration service that meets the specified requirements below.

# Requirements

The API must handle CRUD operations for Students, Subjects, and Exams
Each Student has the following fields:
Student Registration ID (Unique Identifier)
Student Name
List of enrolled Subjects
List of registered Exams
Each Subject has the following fields:
Subject ID (Unique Identifier)
Subject Name
List of registered Students
Each Exam has the following fields:
Exam ID (Unique Identifier)
Subject
List of enrolled Students
The entities must use Foreign Key relationships wherever necessary
Students can register for the exam only after enrolling in the corresponding subject
Handle common errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP codes (Ex. 404, User not found)
Use GlobalExceptionHandler and @ControllerAdvice to organize and streamline Exception Handling
Include basic unit tests while making use of MockMvc and Mockito (Minimum 3)

# Additional Requirement

Easter Egg Feature
In software development, an "Easter egg" refers to a hidden feature, message, or joke intentionally inserted by the developers into the software. 
These Easter eggs are typically meant to be found by users who explore the software thoroughly or stumble upon them by chance. 
Your task is to introduce an easter egg feature using the Numbers API to generate random facts about numbers.
This feature must be triggered whenever a user sends a GET request to a hidden endpoint. 
The endpoint is defined in the “Endpoints” section below.  
You will have read through the Numbers API documentation to achieve this feature.

# Endpoints

Design RESTful endpoints based on the requirements
You can use Spring Data REST to streamline this process if required
POST /exams/{examId} - Registers a student for the specific exam
Easter Egg Feature:
GET /hidden-feature/{number} -  Generate a fact about the number which is passed as the path parameter
Publishing and Documentation
Publish your code to a public GitHub repository
Write meaningful, incremental commit messages
Include a descriptive README.MD for your application codebase
Do not include the easter egg feature in your documentation
Create and add a public Postman Collection in the README.MD (Optional)
